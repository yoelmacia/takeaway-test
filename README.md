# Take-away food test

This is a test code to create a game for takeaway.com

## To install the application once downloaded
```
npm install
```

### To run the reaction application once everything is installed
```
npm start
```

#### To run the js server of the node once everything is installed
```
cd /backend/ 
server.js node
```

#### General description

The application is made with Create-react-app, so it will run at localhost:3000. 

The server will run at localhost:4001.

I have decided to implement the game mode User vs Bot, so just press start game and start the game with the bot according to the established rules.

The application has several components like Modal, ModalFinal and Buttons and a main component called App.

You could create a message component but I have had problems with the use of ref, as this is deprecated.

##### Version 2.0

Implement Redux to save the status.

Complete the game uses for User vs User and Bot vs Bot.

Unit tests must be added to check all functions.

I hope you enjoy it! :D
